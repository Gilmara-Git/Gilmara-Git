### Hi there, I'm Gilmara :woman_technologist:

I am an enthusiastic Software Engineer committed to professional growth and focused on delivering quality applications. 
I am a Team player, and I also work well individually.
My 9-year experience with supporting applications and interacting with Devs, led me to love coding.
I started in bootcamps ([rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) and week coding programs. 
I never stopped studying and I know that being a passionate DEVs I never will.
Among the applications I have developed, I have worked with JavaScript, NodeJS, HTML, CSS, PostgreSQL, React and React Native for mobile applications.

- My goal is to become a better dev today than I was yesterday, so independently of how much I have learned there is always much more, so I study everyday to make things happen.

**Volunteering**:  
- :raising_hand: I'm a volunteer mentor at **Space Squad program** at [rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), which was designed to help programmer students exchange knowledge among themselves.
- :raising_hand: I am a volunteer as a **Web Developer** for the **Siren** project. 
This is an amazing project that works to preserve marine fauna.
On this project I code using React and Bootstrap.
