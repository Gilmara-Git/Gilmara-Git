### Hi there, I'm Gilmara :woman_technologist:

Hello World!
I am graduated in Information Technology and I am interested in Front end/Mobile development. 
After working as a Support Analyst for years I felt I needed to do more. So, instead of supporting existing systems I realized I could be coding them. 
- ðŸŒ± It all started when the pandemic hit us in 2020. I enrolled myself into a bootcamp at [rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), where I have learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Postgres by developing full web applications.
- I have done additional courses to learn and practice javascript and its fundamentals.
- I never stopped learning and never will. 
- As I am focused on front end, I am also exploring the Mobile development, learning and practicing react native.
- I believe persistance and dedication is the key for improvement.
- My goal is to become a better dev today than I was tomorrow, so I study everyday to make that happen.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open sources projects.
- ðŸ’¬ I love to share what I have been learning. Therefore, I often post my progress on linkedIn.
- ðŸ‘‹ I am passionate about the DEV communities out there.
- :raising_hand: I'm a volunteer mentor at **Space Squad program** at [rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), which was designed to help programmer students exchange knowledge among themselves.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **gilmarapq@hotmail.com**
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Persistant, Focus, Empathy, Grateful.
- ðŸ¤” I am looking for an opportunity to collaborate as a software engineer in a team spirit environment, so we all can gain professional growth. .  
- âš¡ Fun fact: shorty.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how you can start learning a second language
-  Keep coding and never give up!
