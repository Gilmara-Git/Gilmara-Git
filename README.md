### Hi there, I'm Gilmara :woman_technologist:

I have graduated in Information Technology Management in 2015 and since then I work with systems.

I have a vast experience in supporting systems; however, after working as a Support Analyst for many years I felt I needed to do more. 

So, instead of supporting systems I realized I could be coding them.  

- 🌱 It all started when the pandemic hit us in 2020. I enrolled myself into a bootcamp at [rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), where I have learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Postgres by developing full web applications, and there is not going back, coding is my thing.
- Since then, I have done and I am always doing additional courses to learn, practice and improve my skills.
- I have been coding Frontend and Mobile projects using JS, React and React Native for some time now.
- My goal is to become a better dev today than I was yesterday, so independently of how much I have learned there is always much more,so I study everyday to make things happen.

**Volunteering**:  
- :raising_hand: I'm a volunteer mentor at **Space Squad program** at [rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), which was designed to help programmer students exchange knowledge among themselves.
- :raising_hand: I am a volunteer as a **Web Developer** for the **Siren** project. On this project I code using React and Bootstrap.
