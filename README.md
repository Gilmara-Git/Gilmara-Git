### Hi there, I'm Gilmara :woman_technologist:

I have graduated in Information Technology Management in 2015 and since then I work with systems.

I have a vast experience in supporting systemsm but after working as a Support Analyst for many years I felt I needed to do more. 

So, instead of supporting systems I realized I could be coding them.  

- ðŸŒ± It all started when the pandemic hit us in 2020. I enrolled myself into a bootcamp at [rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), where I have learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Postgres by developing full web applications.
- I have done and I am always doing additional courses to learn, practice and improve my skills.
- I have been coding Frontend and Mobile projects using JS, React and React Native for some time now.
- My goal is to become a better dev today than I was yesterday, so independently of how much I have learned there always much more, I study everyday to make things happen.
- :raising_hand: I'm a volunteer mentor at **Space Squad program** at [rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), which was designed to help programmer students exchange knowledge among themselves.
- :raising_hand: I am currently voluntering as a Web Developer for the Siren project. On this project I code using React and Bootstrap.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to for my first software engineering position.
- ðŸ’¬ I love to share what I have been learning. Therefore, I often post my progress on linkedIn.
- ðŸ‘‹ I am passionate about the DEV communities out there.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **gilmarapq@hotmail.com**
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Persistant, Focus, Empathy, Grateful.
- ðŸ¤” I am looking for an opportunity to collaborate as a software engineer in a team spirit environment, so we all can gain professional growth. .  
- âš¡ Fun fact: shorty.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how you can start learning a second language
-  Keep coding and never give up!
