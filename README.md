### Hi there, I'm Gilmara ðŸ‘‹

I finally understood why I love technology. It challenges you all the time. Consequently, pushes you to the next level. 
Since I graduated (2015) for Information Technology I have been working as a Support Analyst helping users on their various systems issues. 
But, something was missing, so I realized that learning how to code sounded just right for I could explore the other side. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing a bootcamp at [rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), where I am learning HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Postgres. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on random projects during the bootcamp.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open sources projects.
- ðŸ’¬ I love to share what I have been learning. Therefore, I often post my progress on linkedIn.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how you can start learning a second language, or what I know about Html5, Css3 and JavaScript.
- ðŸ‘‹ I am passionate about the DEV communities out there.
- ðŸ˜„ I'm currently preparing to become a mentor at Space Squad program which was designed to help programmer students exchange knowledge among themselves.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: gilmarapq@hotmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Persistant, Focus, Empathy, Grateful.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™ll eventually be looking for a DEV opportunity.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: shorty.
