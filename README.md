### Hi there, I'm Gilmara :woman_technologist:

Hello World!
Since I graduated (2015) in Information Technology I have been working as a Support Analyst helping users on their various systems issues. 
But deep inside I felt I needed to do more, it was time explore the other side, instead of supporting existing systems I realized I could be coding them. 
- ðŸŒ± I have done a bootcamp at [rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), where I have learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Postgres developing full web applications.
- I never stopped and never will. I have done additional courses to learn and practice javascript and its fundamentals.
- As I am focused on front end, I am also exploring the Mobile development side, learning and practicing react native.
- I believe persistance and dedication is the key for improvement.
- My goal is to become a better dev today than I was tomorrow, so I study everyday to make that happen.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open sources projects.
- ðŸ’¬ I love to share what I have been learning. Therefore, I often post my progress on linkedIn.
- ðŸ‘‹ I am passionate about the DEV communities out there.
- :raising_hand: I'm a volunteer mentor at **Space Squad program** at [rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/), which was designed to help programmer students exchange knowledge among themselves.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **gilmarapq@hotmail.com**
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Persistant, Focus, Empathy, Grateful.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™ll eventually be looking for a DEV opportunity.  
- âš¡ Fun fact: shorty.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how you can start learning a second language
-  Keep coding and never give up!
